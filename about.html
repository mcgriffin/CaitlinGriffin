					Toronto native, Caitlin Griffin began her training with the Oakville Ballet Company, performing in lead roles at a young age under the mentorship of Etienne Lavigne of The National Ballet of Canada. In 2004 she traveled to Vancouver to join The Goh Ballet Academy's Youth Company with whom she performed across Canada and China in a broad spectrum of classical and contemporary repertoire.

					In 2009 Caitlin joined Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal for Ferdnand Nault's Casse Noisette. Her ongoing affiliation with the company has included dancing corps de ballet roles in the annual production for five consecutive seasons. Caitlin has also developed standing affiliations with companies including Ontario Ballet Theatre (2007-2008) MOVE: the company (2009-2011) Henry Daniel’s Full Performing Bodies (2011-2012) with whom she has performed nationally and internationally.

					Additional career highlights include being involved in production for Sony Pictures Feature Film “Center Stage: Turn it Up”, performing at Bangkok’s 13th International Festival of Music and Dance, and the 2010 Winter Olympic Opening Ceremonies during which Caitlin performed for a television audience of over 30 million viewers.  Choreographed by Jean Grand-Maitre and directed by David Atkins, “Sacred Grove” also featured Sarah Machlachlan, Donald Sutherland, and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and played to over 59 thousand live viewers in BC Place.

					In 2012 the BC Arts Council awarded Caitlin a significant professional development grant, enabling her to live in Israel’s Galilee Dance Village where she was immersed in daily practice with pioneers in dance creation including Rami Be’er and Rina Sheinfeld.  Caitlin worked closely with artists from the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company as well as other visiting artists from around the world.  Her experience in Israel culminated with a choreographic showcase and several performances in partnership with the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company.

Festival, The Dance 2 Dance Festival (Audience Choice Award Winner), MOVE: the company, The City of Vancouver’s Biennial Open Air Museum, The Firehall Arts Centre BC Buds and most recently The Dance Centre Open House via Project CPR 5.  In 2013 Caitlin became affiliated with Team Canada Dance as she choreographed a bronze medal winning solo for a young dancer in competition at the World Dance Championships in Poland.  A year later, Caitlin took over the role of head ballet choreographer for the Team and choreographed and prepared the 2014 Team’s group, duet and solo choreography. She accompanied the team to Poland last year.
